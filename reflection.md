Reflection on A7

Nov 5, 2022

I've had fun going around changing my methods (fixing a few from when I submitted them to A6) and optimizing their abilities for what I needed from them. I think my most tricky things are not the general ideas but the very specific = vs == which, after so much time, I should have already known to write that down when anyone reminds me what the difference is. But I have it very prominently displayed in my notebook. I wasn't documenting what was failing before trying to fix the issue, and now that I am I will be able to look back and see how I fixed it last time. I think that'll be a great help to me in the future. 

Overloading documentation: 
In the Cafe class I overloaded the sellCoffee method to accept no input for creams, or sugars. I also overloaded the Cafe constructor to assign default values in inventory, or provided the option of passing in the nCoffeeOunces, which sets the other supplies at an established ratio. The option to enter each supply's value still exists. 

In the House class I overloaded the constructor, so that if no boolean for hasElevator is passed in, then it is false, and if there is one passed in, it is the boolean that is passed in. 

Still need to overload things in library and one more thing in house.

ALSO need to document why i overloaded the ones I did.
